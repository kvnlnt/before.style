Single-File, Classless, Themeable CSS for Semantic HTML

[Website ↗](kvnlnt.github.io/before/)

## Philosophy & Principles

A classless, semantic style reset that styles HTML5 elements directly, providing accessible defaults without relying on utility-first CSS libraries or overly complex frameworks. It is themeable (via CSS custom properties) and designed for progressive enhancement, allowing further customization through classes, components, or frameworks when desired. By targeting semantic HTML, it provides a rock-solid, long-term foundation. All components are implemented according to the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG), ensuring they are accessible, predictable, and keyboard-friendly, so your semantic HTML remains usable for everyone.
